This archetype has been designed to record the examination findings of sputum being observed.
It is assumed that the option to record whether sputum is present/absent or if a cough is productive/unproductive will be captured in the relevant parent archetype.

This archetype has been designed to be used within:
- the 'Examination findings' SLOT in the OBSERVATION.exam and related CLUSTER archetypes; 
- the OBSERVATION.fluid_output to describe the sputum being measured; or
- the OBSERVATION.laboratory_test to desctibe physical properties about a sputum sample/specimen. 

It can also be used within other OBSERVATION or CLUSTER archetypes, where clinically appropriate.">
			keywords = <"sputum", "phlegm">
			misuse = <"Not to be used for recording measurements of sputum volume - use OBSERVATION.fluid_output for this purpose.

Not to be used to record details about saliva.
