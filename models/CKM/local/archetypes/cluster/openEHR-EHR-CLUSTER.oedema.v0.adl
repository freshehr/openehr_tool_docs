This archetype has been designed to be used within the 'Examination findings' SLOT of CLUSTER archetypes for physical examination findings. If used within a CLUSTER.exam_pattern related archetype, the 'Body site' data element and 'Structured body site' SLOT are redundant as the location of oedema will be identified in the Exam CLUSTER. If used within the OBSERVATION.exam archetype or CLUSTERs where the site has not been identified, then 'Body site' and/or 'Structured body site' SLOT will be required.

The CLUSTER.exclusion_exam archetype can be nested within the 'Examination not done' SLOT to optionally record explicit details about the examination not being performed.

Use to incorporate the narrative descriptions of clinical findings within existing or legacy clinical systems into an archetyped format, using the 'Clinical Description' data element.">
