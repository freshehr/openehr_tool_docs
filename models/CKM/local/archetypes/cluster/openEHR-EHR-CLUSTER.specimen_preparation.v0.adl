In general laboratory specimen processing are handled internally by a Laboratory Information system (LIS) and are not reported back to the requesting clinician or persisted in the patient record. However there are some circumstances, particularly in histopathology, where such details are regarded as being critical to interpretation of the results and are carried into the patient record.">
