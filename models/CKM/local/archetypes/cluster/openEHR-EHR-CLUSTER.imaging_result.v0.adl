			use = <"To record imaging results as a single value or as a nested group of result values. Normally used in conjunction with a parent Imaging examination (Observation) archetype.

As well as a single result value, the archetype also allows for a specific anatomical location and further nesting of result values to be captured. The pattern also allows for local clusters to be accommodated.">
