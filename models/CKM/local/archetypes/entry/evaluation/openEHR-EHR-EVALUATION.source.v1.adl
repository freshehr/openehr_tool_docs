This archetype has been designed to support the identification and quality of health information sourced from a third party clinical source. 

Each piece of clinical evidence that has been received from a third party source needs to be assessed as 'fit for use' prior to being utilisied to support clinical decision-making. For example: a digital image captured during a clinical consultation, or a digital radiograph, sent to a remote specialist for assessment and treatment advice needs to be deemed to be of the complete anatomical region and of appropriate quality.">
