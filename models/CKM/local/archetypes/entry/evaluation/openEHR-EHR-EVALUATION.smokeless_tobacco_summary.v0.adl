This archetype is to be used to record information about both current and previous smokeless tobacco usage.

The specific focus of this archetype is on documentation about the use of all types of smokeless tobacco usage because of the associated health risks from this type of consumption.

The specific scope of this archetype is on documentation about the use of all types of smokeless tobacco because of the associated health risks from this kind of consumption. Amount of nicotine and tar, use of bags and additives has been left outside of scope for the core archetype, but could be added into the Episode SLOT if required. 

The 'Per type' cluster of data elements allows for recording of specific details and episodes about each type of tobacco consumed and can be repeated once per type. The list of tobacco types listed in the 'Per type' run-time name constraint identifies the type of smokeless tobacco. This name constraint can be applied during template modelling or at run-time within a software application.

In many situations the individual will only use one type of tobacco, such as snus or snuff.  If other types of tobacco are used the details will be recorded in another instance of the 'Per type' cluster.

The history of waxing and waning of use for each type of tobacco over time can be captured using the repeatable 'Per episode' cluster. This cluster of data elements allows for a very detailed pattern of tobacco usage behaviour to be recorded for each type of tobacco used such as daily usage of snus, alongside occasional use of chewing tobacco while on holiday. 

Triggers for closing one episode and commencing a new one will largely reflect local data collection preferences, including if the individual: 
- quits for a significant period of time (which will likely be locally defined); or
- significantly changes their amount of use or pattern of their usage.

Use to incorporate the narrative descriptions of smokeless tobacco usage habits within existing or legacy clinical systems into an archetyped format, using the 'Overall description' data element.">
