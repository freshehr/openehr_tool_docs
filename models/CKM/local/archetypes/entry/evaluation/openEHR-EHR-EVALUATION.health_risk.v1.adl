			purpose = <"To record known risk factors for an identified disease, condition, or other potentially adverse health issue, and/or an evaluation of the likelihood of the individual experiencing it in the future.

This archetype has been deliberately left open and broad in scope. The 'Health Risk' could be determined from risk factors from any or all of: medical; biomarker; lifestyle; social; occupational hazard; or environmental domains.

The intent of this archetype is to document potential risk at a point in time, and to support decision-making that may reduce the identified risk, whether by clinicians or the individual themselves.">
