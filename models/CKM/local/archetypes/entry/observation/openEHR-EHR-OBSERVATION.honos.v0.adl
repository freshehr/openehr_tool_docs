			purpose = <"Records the HoNOS score as a simple, repeatable method to document the service user's health or social status at a specific point in time, say at the start or end of an episode of care, after a course of treatment or some other intervention.">
			use = <"The use of HoNOS is recommended by the English National Service Framework for Mental Health and by the working group to the Department of Health on outcome indicators for severe mental illnesses.
HoNOS is the most widely used routine clinical outcome measure used by English mental health services.

The 12 scales that are scored are:
1. Overactive, aggressive, disruptive or agitated behaviour
2. Non-accidental self-injury
3. Problem drinking or drug-taking
4. Cognitive problems
5. Physical illness or disability problems
6. Problems associated with hallucinations and delusions
7. Problems with depressed mood
8. Other mental and behavioural problems
9. Problems with relationships
10. Problems with activities of daily living
11. Problems with living conditions
12. Problems with occupation and activities

All scales follow the format:
0 = no problem
1 = minor problem requiring no action
2 = mild problem but definitely present
3 = moderately severe problem
4 = severe to very severe problem 

Each scale is rated in order from 1 to 12. Do not include information rated in an earlier item except for item 10 which is an overall rating. The rating is made on the basis of all information available to the rater (whatever the source) and is based on the most severe problem that occurred during the period rated (usually the two weeks leading up to the point of rating).

The HoNOS system is not a standardised clinical assessment and cannot be a substitute for one.

The minimum required is that a rating is made at the start of each episode of care and at the end. Most services using HoNOS also require ratings at any regular review (like the English Care Programme Approach review), when there is a major change in the patient's status (for instance, an admission to or discharge from hospital) HoNOS Score is a copyrighted assessment score: Health of the Nation Outcome Scales (HoNOS) © Royal College of Psychiatrists 1996.
