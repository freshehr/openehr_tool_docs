This archetype is intended only to act as a container archetype that supports flexible expression of existing CLUSTER archetypes. It is not intended to hold any content other than the unconstrained SLOT.

For example, the CLUSTER.nyha_heart_failure archetype is most commonly used to provide a standardised assessment of heart failure with EVALUATION.problem_diagnosis archetypes, but by inserting it within this OBSERVATION allows it to be recorded as data outside the context of a Diagnosis, if clinically appropriate. Similarly CLUSTER.tos is usually recorded by ENT specialists in the context of an examination using CLUSTER.exam_tympanic_membrane, but by inserting it into this archetype, it allows it to be recorded outside the context of examination findings, if clinically appropriate.">
