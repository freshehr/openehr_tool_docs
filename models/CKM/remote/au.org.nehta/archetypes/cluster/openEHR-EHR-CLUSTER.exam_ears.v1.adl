This archetype has been specifically designed to be used in the 'Examination detail' SLOT within the OBSERVATION.exam archetype, but can also be used within other OBSERVATION or CLUSTER archetypes, where clinically appropriate.

Use to provide a framework in which CLUSTER archetypes can be nested in the 'Examination findings' SLOT to record additional structured physical examination findings - for example, CLUSTER.exam_tympanic_membrane, CLUSTER.exam_auditory_canal and CLUSTER.exam.pinna. 

The CLUSTER.exclusion_exam archetype can be nested within the 'Examination not done' SLOT to optionally record explicit details about the examination not being performed.

Use to incorporate the narrative descriptions of clinical findings within existing or legacy clinical systems into an archetyped format, using the 'Clinical Description' data element.">

			misuse = <"Not to be used for recording data not related to the physical examination of the ears.

Not to be used to record data about measurements made during hearing assessments - use specific purpose-built OBSERVATION archetypes. For example: OBSERVATION.audiometry_result or OBSERVATION.tympanogram_226hz.

Not to be used for recording the clinical history - use specific OBSERVATION and CLUSTER archetypes. For example OBSERVATION.story and CLUSTER.symptom_sign.">
