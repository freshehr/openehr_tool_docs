Use to record the interpretation all tympanogram measurements taken with a high frequency probe tone (probetone higher than 226 Hz) or a multi-frequency probe tone, to infer middle ear function for each ear, plus an overall interpretation (or tympanometric diagnosis). 

All of the data elements are recorded using a single method or protocol. If, during the test, any of the protocol parameters need to be modified, then the subsequent part of the test will need to be recorded within a separate instance of the test data, using the updated protocol parameters.

High frequency tympanometry is the test of choice in newborn to the age of two months. Both 226hz and high frequency tympanometry can be used together to test infants from from two to six months.">
