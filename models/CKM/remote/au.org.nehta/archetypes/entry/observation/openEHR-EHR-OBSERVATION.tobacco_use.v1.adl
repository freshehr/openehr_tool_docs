A smoking or tobacco use diary could be built up over time by recording the use of tobacco on multiple, sequential days - recording actual consumptions using the 'Specified Day' event for each daily entry.

A record of typical tobacco use during a period can be recorded by recording the amount of tobacco used using the 'Average use' event - the mean use over a specified period of time.">
